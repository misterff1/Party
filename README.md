Party
===========

A passive script for Just Cause 2 Multiplayer. Type /party and you will enter the party world in which you spawn as a male stripper with nothing but bubbleguns. This is nice to use when you don't want to get killed and just want to talk to people. Type /party again and you will be restored to your old position in the defaultworld.
