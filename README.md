Party
===========

Party is the first script I made for Just Cause 2 Multiplayer. It creates a world in which players can have some fun at the Mile High Club with only a male stripper outfit and two bubbleguns. 

Usage:
Type /party to enter the party world and type /party again to exit. When you die while inside the party world, you will spawn back at the Mile High Club again until you exit. 

Update may 2015: The script is now rewritten to heavily reduce its size and optimize its contents. When I first made this script I only ported over the contents of derby, which resulted in a lot of data that wasn't useful anymore. I figured I had to rewrite it to finally get rid of it. The code is now very clean and a lot smaller than it used to be. I recommend you to update to this newer version if possible to avoid any problems you may have had thanks to the old version.
